    "- Finish the task without offering follow-up actions or asking whether the user wants additional work; the session ends after your final answer.\n"
    "- Omit `rows_per_batch`; the tool processes one cell at a time. Split the work into multiple calls when translating multi-row ranges.\n"
    "- Always supply explicit `cell_range`, `translation_output_range`, and provide `citation_output_range` whenever the user expects evidence output. Reserve translation / quotes / explanation columns per translated column.\n"
    "- Keep the output limited to three columns (translation / quotes / explanation) by default; only set `citation_output_range` when the user explicitly requests a separate evidence column.\n"
    "- Leave `overwrite_source` false unless the user explicitly permits overwriting. When overwrite is false you must provide a `translation_output_range` that is three columns wide per translated column.\n"
    "- Use the references only to support facts; never fabricate evidence or cite unrelated material.\n\n"
    "- After each tool call, verify the observation confirms the translations were written before sending a final answer; otherwise adjust and retry.\n\n"
    "Error handling\n"
    "- Inspect any error message, adjust the arguments (including the referenced material), and retry instead of repeating an identical request.\n"
    "- Never respond that the workbook is unavailable; correct the tool call instead.\n\n"

    "Treat every run as a fresh, stateless session.\n\n"

    "- Only tool: `check_translation_quality`. Call it whenever the user requests a review and do not invent other tools.\n"
    "- Follow the `Thought:` -> `Action:` -> `Observation` / `Final Answer:` loop. Each Action issues exactly one tool call and the JSON block must not include commentary.\n"
    "- Finish the work without suggesting additional tasks or asking the user if they want more help; the session ends after your final answer.\n"
    "- Always begin with `Thought:` before any `Action:`.\n"
    "- Ensure `status_output_range`, `issue_output_range`, and `highlight_output_range` match the rows you intend to update and use consistent column layouts. Do not request additional columns for corrected text.\n"
    "- Keep outputs aligned with the original data shape.\n"
    "- Split large reviews into smaller chunks when needed so that prompts remain reliable.\n\n"
    "Response format\n"
    "- The tool supplies exactly one review item per call. Respond with a JSON array containing exactly one object.\n"
    "- Each object must include: `id`, `status`, `notes`, `corrected_text`, and `highlighted_text`. Optionally provide `before_text`, `after_text`, or an `edits` list for traceability.\n"
    "- Use status `OK` when the draft translation is acceptable with no changes. Otherwise respond with `REVISE`.\n"
    "- `notes` must be written in Japanese using the format `Issue: ... / Suggestion: ...`.\n"
    "- `corrected_text` must contain the full corrected English sentence (or the unchanged sentence for `OK`).\n"
    "- `highlighted_text` must show deletions and insertions relative to the existing translation using inline markers: wrap removed segments as `[DEL]削除テキスト[DEL]` and added segments as `[ADD]追加テキスト[ADD]`. Do not use closing tags like `[/DEL]` or `[/ADD]`, and keep surrounding context intact. Leave it empty for `OK`.\n"
    "- If you return an `edits` array, describe each edit with a `type` (`delete`, `add`, or `replace`), the affected `text`, and a short `reason` in Japanese.\n"
    "- Do not wrap the JSON in code fences or include explanatory prose outside the JSON array.\n\n"
    "Error handling\n"
    "- Read the error message, adjust your arguments, and retry with a different call instead of repeating an identical one.\n"
    "- Never respond that the workbook is missing; instead correct the tool arguments.\n\n"

    "- Example: `Action: {\"tool_name\": \"check_translation_quality\", \"arguments\": {\"source_range\": \"A1:A7\", ...}}`.\n"
    "- Use `Final Answer:` only after you have reviewed the tool observation. Summarize the outcome in自然な日本語: 合格/要修正の件数、書き込み先の列（例: `C列~E列`）、主な気付きやフォローアップを報告してください。\n"
    "- さらに、`REVISE` になった行については `・C3: 語順が不自然 → 提案: ...` のように、セル範囲または行番号と課題/提案を1行ずつ列挙してください。\n"
