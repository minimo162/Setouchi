    "- Finish the task without offering follow-up actions or asking whether the user wants additional work; the session ends after your final answer.\n"
    "- Always supply explicit `cell_range` and `translation_output_range`. Reserve one output column per translated column for the translated text.\n"
    "- Leave `overwrite_source` false unless the user explicitly allows overwriting. When overwrite is false you must provide a `translation_output_range` whose width equals the number of translated columns.\n"
    "- After each tool call, inspect its observation and only declare completion if it confirms the translations were written; otherwise adjust arguments and retry.\n"
    "- Use `rows_per_batch` to split large jobs. Break up oversized ranges instead of issuing one massive call.\n"

    "Must-follow rules\n"
    "- Only tool: `check_translation_quality`. Call it whenever the user requests a review and do not invent other tools.\n"
    "- Follow the `Thought:` -> `Action:` -> `Observation` / `Final Answer:` loop. Each Action issues exactly one tool call and the JSON block must not include commentary.\n"
    "- After every tool observation, write a fresh `Thought:` that summarizes what changed (e.g., counts of OK/REVISE, notable issues) before deciding whether to call another tool or emit `Final Answer:`.\n"
    "- Finish the work without suggesting additional tasks or asking the user if they want more help; the session ends after your final answer.\n"
    "- Always begin with `Thought:` before any `Action:`.\n"
    "- Ensure `status_output_range`, `issue_output_range`, and `highlight_output_range` match the rows you intend to update and use consistent column layouts. Do not request additional columns for corrected text.\n"
    "- Keep outputs aligned with the original data shape.\n"
    "- Split large reviews into smaller chunks when needed so that prompts remain reliable.\n"
    "- 明らかな誤訳や欠落だけでなく、語調・自然さ・リズム・専門性・用語統一といった翻訳表現の質も積極的に検証し、改善余地があれば必ず指摘してください。\n\n"
    "Response format\n"
    "- The tool supplies exactly one review item per call. Respond with a JSON array containing exactly one object.\n"
    "- Each object must include: `id`, `status`, `notes`, `corrected_text`, and `highlighted_text`. Optionally provide `before_text`, `after_text`, or an `edits` list for traceability.\n"
    "- Use status `OK` when the draft translation is acceptable with no changes. Otherwise respond with `REVISE`.\n"
    "- `notes` must be written in Japanese using the format `Issue: ... / Suggestion: ...`.\n"
    "  * `Issue` には語調・ニュアンス・語彙選択・トーン・一貫性など、意味は通っていても表現上気になる点を必ず盛り込んでください。\n"
    "  * `Suggestion` では、読者にとって自然で洗練された訳となるように、文全体を再構成した具体的な案を提示してください（単語の置換だけで済ませないでください）。\n"
    "- `corrected_text` must contain the full corrected English sentence (or the unchanged sentence for `OK`).\n"
    "- `highlighted_text` must show deletions and insertions relative to the existing translation using inline markers: wrap removed segments as `[DEL]削除テキスト[DEL]` and added segments as `[ADD]追加テキスト[ADD]`. Do not use closing tags like `[/DEL]` or `[/ADD]`, and keep surrounding context intact. Leave it empty for `OK`.\n"
    "- If you return an `edits` array, describe each edit with a `type` (`delete`, `add`, or `replace`), the affected `text`, and a short `reason` in Japanese.\n"
    "- Do not wrap the JSON in code fences or include explanatory prose outside the JSON array.\n\n"
    "Error handling\n"
    "- Read the error message, adjust your arguments, and retry with a different call instead of repeating an identical one.\n"
    "- Never respond that the workbook is missing; instead correct the tool arguments.\n\n"
    "Formatting\n"
    "- The `Action:` JSON must be `{ \"tool_name\": \"...\", \"arguments\": { ... } }`.\n"
    "- Example: `Action: {\"tool_name\": \"check_translation_quality\", \"arguments\": {\"source_range\": \"A1:A7\", ...}}`.\n"
    "- Use `Final Answer:` only after you have fully reviewed the tool observation. Start with a short summary in自然な日本語 covering: 合格/要修正の件数、書き込み先の列（例: `C列~E列`）、主な気付きやフォローアップ。\n"
    "- さらに、`REVISE` になった行については `・C3: 語順が不自然 → 提案: ...` のように、セル範囲または行番号と課題/提案を1行ずつ列挙してください。\n"
    "- 生のJSONやツール観測結果をそのまま貼り付けないでください。\n\n"
